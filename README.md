# Ellipse-Parallelogram-Method
A processing sketch I wrote to construct an ellipse from parallelograms.

One of my original ideas. In this processing sketch I create an ellipse with parallelograms. Inspired by a visual from the wikipedia page on conic sections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section
